# Design Patterns in Ruby

Hello and welcome! This repository serves as a personal reference for implementing design patterns in Ruby, based on the classic Gang of Four (GOF) design patterns.

This code is modeled after implementations from `Design Patterns in Ruby` by Russ Olsen

### What Are Design Patterns?
Design patterns are `reusable solutions` to common software design problems in object-oriented programming (OOP). These patterns are well-tested and provide elegant solutions to maintainable code

### What To Know Before Learning?
NOTHING! Well ok, maybe some basic programming, so here's a short list:
* Data Types: Int, Floats, Strings, Char, bool
* Variables
* PEMDAS and logical operators (<, <=, >, >=, &&, ||, !, ==)
* Arrays (What it means to push and pop, stack/queue)
* Hashmaps (key value pair dictionary)
* If statements (If this happens do this, elsif, and else)
* loops (While, foreach)
* Import statement (Or any other term for grabbing code from another class)
* Inheritance and Interfaces (Parent/Child structure vs glued on functionality)
* Function (reusable code)
* Class (blue print of an object)
* What an Object and calling functions via dotv notation
* Commenting code

That seems like a lot, but believe me, it's not. All these concepts can be learned pretty quickly, and if you know them cold then you're ready!
